# Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++
**This repo is now archived. I'm happy to say that I've progressed in C++ via other projects.**

Selected exercises for Bjarne Stroustrup's *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ (2nd ed.)*

I do not intend to implement every problem for a given chapter. For some (most?), I simply think through how I would program the solution. I may complete them if I need review in the future.

## Tooling (in progress)

- Compiler: Clang
- GNU Make (scripting)
